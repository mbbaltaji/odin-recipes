  <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Basil</li>
    <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>First, make sure you use quality ingredients. There aren’t very many ingredients so you want to make sure all of the ingredients are high quality.</li>
    <li>We use canned tomatoes for this recipe, but ONLY San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes. They are the BEST canned tomatoes. Make sure you use them to get the best flavor for the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li>Puree the tomatoes in a food processor or blender before you get started.</li>
    <li>We use spaghetti, but you can use bucatini, angel hair, or fettuccini. We love DeLallo’s pasta!</li>
    <li>Add a little crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a little kick. If the kids are going to eat it, you can leave them out, but our boys are fine with a little heat.</li>
    <li>Make sure you reserve ½ cup of the pasta water so you can add it back into the sauce. Don’t miss this step.</li>
    <li>Add a little butter to the pasta at the end. You only need two tablespoons, but those two tablespoons make a big difference. The butter adds a richness to the pasta.
    </li>
    <li>Don’t be skimpy with the fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Also, buy the GOOD Parmesan cheese for this recipe.
