    <li>2 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
    <li>6 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained</li>
    <li>â…” cup orange juice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add dried chiles; cook, turning 
      occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 
      cup water to just cover the chiles, and bring to a simmer over medium-high.
       Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, 2/3 cup onion, orange juice, vinegar, 
      oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 30 seconds.
       Reserve 1/2 cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; 
      toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or up
       to 24 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature while chicken marinates.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position oven rack 8 inches away from heating element. Line a small roasting
       pan or 13- x 9-inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
